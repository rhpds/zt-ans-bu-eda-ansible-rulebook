== Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the URL Check plugin with `ansible-rulebook` to monitor website availability and automatically remediate failures. You'll learn how to implement continuous monitoring and automated recovery for web services.

== Introduction to URL Monitoring

The URL Check plugin provides a straightforward approach to website monitoring. This plugin allows us to poll the status of websites continuously, enabling us to detect and respond to issues automatically as they arise.

In this example, we will:

* Configure continuous URL monitoring
* Simulate a website failure scenario
* Implement automated remediation workflows
* Observe the complete monitoring and recovery cycle

[NOTE]
====
The URL Check source plugin operates on a simple principle: if the webserver responds with a page, the URL is considered 'up'; if there is no response or error, it's considered 'down'.
====

== URL Check Configuration

This example demonstrates monitoring a web service and implementing automated recovery when issues are detected.

=== Step 1: Examine the URL Check Rulebook

. **From the editor tab**, inspect the `url-check-example.yml` rulebook and take note of the source plugin configuration.

. **Observe the source configuration** which includes:
   * Target URL for monitoring
   * Multiple URL support capability
   * Configurable delay intervals for ongoing checks

The URL Check source plugin provides continuous monitoring by checking webservers at regular intervals defined by the delay parameter.

[TIP]
====
You can configure multiple URLs in a single rulebook and set different delay intervals to customize monitoring frequency based on your requirements.
====

=== Step 2: Understanding the Monitoring Logic

The monitoring logic works as follows:

* **Up Status**: When the webserver responds with a page, the URL is considered 'up'
* **Down Status**: When there's no page response or connection failure, it's considered 'down'
* **Continuous Monitoring**: The plugin will keep checking at configured intervals
* **Event Generation**: Status changes trigger events that can activate remediation playbooks

In this example, we will:

* Keep `ansible-rulebook` running and checking our webserver
* Remove the `index.html` page to simulate a failure
* Trigger automatic remediation when the page becomes unavailable

== Hands-On Testing

=== Step 3: Start URL Monitoring

. **Navigate to the ansible-rulebook tab** and start the rulebook:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-rulebook --rulebook url-check-example.yml -i inventory_web.yml --print-events
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that we are using a different inventory file (`inventory_web.yml`) for this exercise, which contains the webserver configuration.
====

=== Step 4: Verify Initial Website Status

. **From the Terminal tab**, perform a curl request to verify the webserver is responding:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl webserver
----

. **Observe the response** - you should receive a basic webpage, confirming the service is operational.

. **Check the ansible-rulebook tab** and observe the monitoring messages showing the page is live and triggering the "all is well" playbook.

=== Step 5: Simulate a Failure Scenario

Now let's create a realistic failure scenario to test our automated remediation:

. **From the Webserver tab**, simulate a website failure by deleting the index.html file:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
----

. **Monitor the ansible-rulebook tab** - after the configured delay period, `ansible-rulebook` will detect the failed state and automatically trigger the remediation playbook.

=== Step 6: Observe Automated Remediation

You should see output similar to the following in the ansible-rulebook tab:

[source,text]
----
TASK [debug] *******************************************************************
ok: [webserver] => {
    "msg": "Website is down!"
}

TASK [Replace website] *********************************************************
changed: [webserver]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
webserver : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
----

. **Verify recovery** - the remediation playbook will restore the missing index.html file.

. **Continue monitoring** - after remediation, the delayed checks will continue, and the website should return to 'up' status.

== Understanding the Complete Workflow

The complete monitoring and remediation workflow includes:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: URL Check plugin polls the target URL at regular intervals
2. **Status Detection**: Plugin detects when the website becomes unavailable
3. **Event Triggering**: Failure condition triggers the remediation rulebook
4. **Automated Recovery**: Remediation playbook restores the missing content
5. **Return to Normal**: Monitoring continues and detects the restored service

== Key Benefits

**Proactive Monitoring**:: Continuous health checks detect issues before users report them

**Automated Response**:: Immediate remediation reduces downtime and manual intervention

**Scalable Solution**:: Multiple URLs can be monitored with a single rulebook configuration

**Simple Implementation**:: Straightforward plugin requiring minimal configuration

**Enterprise Ready**:: Suitable for production monitoring with proper alerting integration

== Advanced Configuration Options

The URL Check plugin supports various configuration options:

* **Multiple URLs**: Monitor several endpoints simultaneously
* **Custom Delays**: Configure check intervals based on criticality
* **Response Validation**: Customize what constitutes a successful response
* **Timeout Settings**: Define connection timeout thresholds

== Next Steps

* Configure monitoring for multiple critical URLs
* Implement escalation procedures for repeated failures
* Integrate with alerting systems for notification workflows
* Develop more sophisticated remediation playbooks
* Add logging and metrics collection for monitoring analytics
* Explore integration with load balancers and health check systems
